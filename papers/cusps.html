<P>
Following recent work of Chernov, Markarian, and Zhang, it is known
that the billiard map for dispersing billiards with zero angle
cusps has slow decay of correlations with rate 1/n.
Since the collisions inside a cusp occur in quick succession, it is
reasonable to expect a much faster decay rate in continuous time.
In this paper we prove that the flow is <em>rapid mixing</em>:
correlations decay faster than any polynomial rate.
A consequence is that the flow admits strong statistical properties such as
the almost sure invariance principle, even though the billiard map
does not.
<P>
The techniques in this paper yield new results for other standard examples
in planar billiards, including Bunimovich flowers and stadia.
