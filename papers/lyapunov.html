<P>
The Lyapunov exponents of symmetric attractors can be forced to be multiple by
``instantaneous symmetries'' which fix the attractor pointwise.
In this paper, we show that ``symmetries on average'' which fix the attractor
as a set may lead to further multiplicities.
This work is motivated by, and provides an explanation for, numerical
computations by Aston & Laing of Lyapunov exponents for the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation.
