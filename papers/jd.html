<P>
Systems of reaction-diffusion equations
posed on bounded rectangular domains with Neumann boundary conditions
often exhibit behavior that seems degenerate given
the physical symmetries of the problem.  It is now well-understood
that Neumann boundary conditions lead to hidden symmetries that
are responsible for subtle changes in the generic bifurcations
of such systems.
 
<P>
In this article, we consider the analogous situation for
partially unbounded domains such as the strip <B>R</B>x[0,\pi].
We show that hidden symmetries due to assuming Neumann boundary conditions
have remarkable consequences for
the validity of Ginzburg-Landau equations which govern the local bifurcations.
A single Ginzburg-Landau equation (which is universal for general boundary
conditions on <B>R</B>x[0,\pi]) no longer suffices in general.
Instead, it is necessary to consider p coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations,
where p is an arbitrary positive integer.
