<p>

We consider deterministic fast-slow dynamical systems of the form
<p>
x<sub>k+1</sub><sup>(n)</sup>
= x<sub>k</sub><sup>(n)</sup>
+ n<sup>-1</sup>A(x<sub>k</sub><sup>(n)</sup>) + n<sup>-1/&alpha;</sup>B(x<sub>k</sub><sup>(n)</sup>)v(y<sub>k</sub>),   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
y<sub>k+1</sub> = Ty<sub>k</sub>.
</p>
where &alpha; &in; (1,2) and  and x<sub>k</sub><sup>(n)</sup> &in; R<sup>m</sup>.

Here, T is a slowly mixing nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical system and
the process W<sub>n</sub>(t)=n<sup>-1/&alpha;</sup> &sum;<sub>k=1</sub><sup>[nt]</sup> v(y<sub>k</sub>) converges weakly to a d-dimensional &alpha;-stable  L&eacute;evy process L<sub>&alpha;</sub>.

We are interested in convergence of the m-dimensional process X<sub>n</sub>(t)=
 x<sub>[nt]</sub><sup>(n)</sup> to the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE)
<p>
    dX = A(X)dt + B(X)dL<sub>&alpha;</sub>.
</p>
In the simplest cases considered in previous work,
the limiting SDE has the Marcus interpretation.
In particular, the SDE is Marcus if the
noise coefficient B is exact or if
the excursions for W<sub>n</sub> converge to straight lines as n&rarr;&infin;.

Outside these simplest situations, it turns out that  typically the Marcus interpretation fails.
We develop a general theory that does not rely on exactness or linearity of excursions. To achieve this, it is necessary to consider suitable spaces of ``decorated'' c&agrave;dl&agrave;g paths and to interpret the limiting decorated SDE. In this way, we are able to cover more complicated examples such as billiards with flat cusps where the limiting SDE is typically non-Marcus for m&geq;2.
