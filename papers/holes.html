We study two classes of dynamical systems with
holes:  expanding maps of the interval and Collet-Eckmann maps
with singularities.
In both cases, we prove that there is a natural absolutely continuous
conditionally invariant measure m (accim) with
the physical property that strictly positive H&ouml;lder continuous
functions converge to the density of m under the renormalized dynamics
of the system.  In addition, we construct an invariant measure
m', supported on the Cantor set of points that never escape
from the system, that is ergodic and enjoys exponential decay of correlations
for H&ouml;lder observables.  We show that m' satisfies
an equilibrium principle which implies
that the escape rate formula, familiar to the thermodynamic formalism,
holds outside the usual setting.  In particular, it holds for Collet-Eckmann
maps with holes, which are not uniformly hyperbolic and do not admit a
finite Markov partition.
<p>
We use a general framework of Young towers with holes
and first prove results about the accim and the invariant measure on the
tower.
Then we show how to transfer results to the original dynamical system.
This approach can be expected to generalize to other dynamical systems than
the two above classes.
