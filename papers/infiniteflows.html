<B> Abstract </B> 
We obtain results on mixing for a large class of (not necessarily Markov) infinite measure semiflows and flows.  Erickson proved, amongst other things, a strong renewal theorem in the corresponding i.i.d. setting.
Using operator renewal theory, we extend Erickson's methods to the deterministic (i.e. non-i.i.d.) continuous time setting and obtain results on mixing as a consequence.
<P>
Our results apply to intermittent semiflows and flows
of Pomeau-Manneville type (both Markov and nonMarkov), and to semiflows and flows over Collet-Eckmann maps with nonintegrable roof function.
