<P>
Systems possessing symmetries often admit heteroclinic cycles that
persist under perturbations that respect the symmetry.  The asymptotic
stability of such cycles has previously been studied on an ad hoc basis
by many authors.  Sufficient conditions, but usually not necessary
conditions, for stability of these cycles have been obtained via a
variety of different techniques.
 
<P>
We begin a systematic investigation into the asymptotic stability of
such cycles.  A general sufficient condition for asymptotic stability
is obtained, together with algebraic criteria for deciding when this
condition is also necessary.  These criteria are always satisfied in
<B>R</B><sup>3</sup> and often satisfied in higher dimensions.  We end by applying
our results to several higher dimensional examples that occur in mode
interactions with <B>O</B>(2) symmetry.
