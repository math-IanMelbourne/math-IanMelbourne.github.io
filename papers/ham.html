<P>
 One of the goals of this paper is to describe explicitly the generic
movement
 of eigenvalues through a one-to-one resonance in a linear Hamiltonian
system
 which is equivariant with respect to a symplectic representation of
 a compact Lie group. We classify this movement, and hence answer the
 question of when the collisions are ``dangerous'' in the sense of Krein by
 using a combination of group theory and definiteness properties of the
 associated quadratic Hamiltonian.  For example, for systems with
 no symmetry or <B>O</B>(2) symmetry generically the eigenvalues split,
 whereas for systems with <i>S</i><sup>1</sup> symmetry, generically the eigenvalues
 may split or pass. It is in this last case that one has to use both
 group theory and energetics to determine the generic eigenvalue movement.
 The result is to be contrasted with the bifurcation of
 steady states (zero eigenvalue) where one can use either group theory alone
(Golubitsky and Stewart)
 or definiteness properties of the Hamiltonian
 (Cartan-Oh) to determine if the eigenvalues split or pass on the imaginary
 axis.
