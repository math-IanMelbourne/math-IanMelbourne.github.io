<P>
Topological transitivity of noncompact group extensions of topologically 
mixing subshifts of finite type has been studied recently by Nitica.
We build on these methods, and give the first examples of <EM>stably</EM> 
transitive noncompact group extensions of hyperbolic dynamical systems.
Our examples include extensions of hyperbolic basic sets by the Euclidean 
group <B>SE</B>(n) for n even, n>3.
