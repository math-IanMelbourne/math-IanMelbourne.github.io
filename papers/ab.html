<P>
The symmetry groups of attractors for smooth equivariant dynamical
systems have been classified when the underlying group of symmetries
$\Gamma$ is finite.  The problems that arise when $\Gamma$ is compact but
infinite are of a completely different nature. We investigate the case
when the connected component of the identity $\Gamma<sup>0</sup>$ is abelian and show
that under fairly mild assumptions on the dynamics, it is typically the
case that the symmetry of an $\omega$-limit set contains the continuous
symmetries $\Gamma<sup>0</sup>$.  Here, typicality is interpreted in both a
topological and probabilistic sense (genericity and prevalence).
