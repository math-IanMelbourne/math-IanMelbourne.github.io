<P>
We consider dynamical systems that are equivariant under a noncompact Lie
group of symmetries and the drift of relative equilibria in such systems.
In particular, we investigate how the drift for a parametrized family of
normally hyperbolic relative equilibria can change character at what we call
a `drift bifurcation'.
To do this, we use results of Arnold to analyze parametrized families
of elements in the Lie algebra of the symmetry group.

<P>
We examine effects in physical space of such drift bifurcations
for planar reaction-diffusion systems and note that these effects can explain
certain aspects of the transition from rigidly rotating spirals to
rigidly propagating `retracting waves'.
This is a bifurcation observed in
numerical simulations of excitable media where the rotation rate of a family
of spirals slows down and gives way to a semi-infinite translating
wavefront.
