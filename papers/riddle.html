<B> Abstract </B>

<P>
 Let M be the four-dimensional compact manifold 
M=T<SUP>2</SUP>xS<SUP>2</SUP>          
  and let k>1.  We construct a C<sup>&infin;</sup> diffeomorphism          
  F : M -> M  with precisely k intermingled minimal attractors         
  A<SUB>1</SUB>,...,A<SUB>k</SUB>.  Moreover the union of the basins is a
 set of full Lebesgue measure. This means that Lebesgue almost every point  
  in M lies in the basin of attraction of A<SUB>j</SUB> for some j, but     
  every open set in M has a positive measure intersection with each          
  basin.                                                                       
<P>
  We also construct  F : M -> M  with a countable infinity of       
  intermingled minimal attractors.
