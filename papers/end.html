<P>
We consider the statistical properties of endomorphisms 
under the assumption that the associated 
Perron-Frobenius operator is quasicompact.  In particular
we consider the central limit theorem, weak invariance principle,
law of the iterated logarithm and exponential decay of correlations
for sufficiently regular observations.
Our approach clarifies the role of the usual assumptions of ergodicity,
weak-mixing and exactness.
<P>
We also give sufficient conditions for quasicompactness of the 
Perron-Frobenius operator to lift to the corresponding 
equivariant operator on a compact group extension of the base.
This leads to statistical limit theorems
and exponential decay of correlations for equivariant observations
on compact group extensions.
<P>
Examples considered include compact group extensions of 
piecewise uniformly expanding maps (for example Lasota-Yorke maps), 
and subshifts of finite type, as well as systems that are nonuniformly 
expanding or nonuniformly hyperbolic.
