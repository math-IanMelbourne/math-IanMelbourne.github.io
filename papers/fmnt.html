<P>

Recent work of Dolgopyat shows that 
``typical'' hyperbolic flows exhibit rapid decay of
correlations.  
<a href="time1.html">Melbourne and T&#246;r&#246;k</a>
 used this result to derive
statistical limit laws such as the central limit theorem and the almost
sure invariance principle for the time-one map of such flows.

<P> 
In this paper, we extend these results to equivariant observations
on compact group extensions of hyperbolic flows and their time one maps.
