We prove a nonstandard central limit theorem and weak invariance principle,
with superdiffusive normalisation $(t\log t)^{1/2}$, for geodesic flows on a class of nonpositively curved
surfaces with flat cylinder. We also prove that correlations decay at rate~$t^{-1}$.
An important ingredient of the proof, which is of independent interest, is an improved
results on the regularity of the stable/unstable foliations induced by the Green bundles.
