<P>
We study local bifurcation in equivariant dynamical systems
from periodic solutions with a mixture
of spatial and spatiotemporal symmetries.
<P>
In previous work, we focused primarily on codimension one
bifurcations. In this paper, we show that the techniques used in the
codimension one analysis can be extended to understand also higher codimension
bifurcations, including resonant bifurcations and mode interactions.
In particular, we present a general reduction scheme by which we relate
bifurcations from periodic solutions to bifurcations from fixed points
of twisted
equivariant diffeomorphisms, which in turn are linked via normal form
theory to bifurcations from equilibria of equivariant vector fields.
<P>
We also obtain a general theory for bifurcation from relative periodic
solutions and
we show how to incorporate time-reversal symmetries into our framework.
