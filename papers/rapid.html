<B> Abstract </B>
 We obtain general results on the stability of mixing and rapid mixing
  (superpolynomial decay of correlations) for hyperbolic flows.  Amongst
  C<SUP>r</SUP> Axiom A flows, $r\ge2$, we show that there is a 
C<SUP>2</SUP>-open, C<SUP>r</SUP>-dense set of flows for which each nontrivial hyperbolic basic set
  is rapid mixing. This is the first general result on the stability of
  rapid mixing (or even mixing) for Axiom A flows that holds in a 
C<SUP>r</SUP>, as opposed to H&ouml;lder, topology.

Previous preprints from May 2003 and July 2004 established results on stability
of mixing and rapid mixing respectively, under the additional hypothesis
<br> r \ge 2dim M - 1 <br>
 where M is the ambient manifold.
The current preprint removes this restriction and hence supercedes the previous
preprints.
