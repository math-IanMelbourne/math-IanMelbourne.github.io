We consider a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with a first return time satisfying a central limit theorem (CLT) with nonstandard normalisation (n log n)<sup>1/2</sup>. For such systems (both maps and flows)
we show that it automatically follows that the functional central limit theorem or weak invariance principle (WIP) with normalisation (n log n)<sup>1/2</sup> holds for H&umlo;older observables.

Our approach streamlines certain arguments in the literature. Applications include various examples from billiards, geodesic flows and intermittent dynamical systems. In this way, we unify existing results as well as obtaining new results.
In particular, we deduce the WIP with nonstandard normalisation for Bunimovich stadia as an immediate consequence of the corresponding CLT proved by B&acutee;lint \& Gou&umle;zel.
