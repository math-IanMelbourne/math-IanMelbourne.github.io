<P>
In both experimental studies and numerical simulations of waves
in excitable media, rigidly rotating spiral waves are observed to
undergo transitions to complicated spatial dynamics with
long-term Brownian-like motion of the spiral tip. This phenomenon is
known as hypermeander.

<P>
In this paper, we review a number of recent results on
dynamics with noncompact group symmetries and make the case
that hypermeander may occur at a codimension two bifurcation
from a rigidly rotating spiral wave.  Our predictions are
based on center bundle reduction (Sandstede, Scheel & Wulff),
and on central limit theorems and invariance principles for noncompact
group extensions of hyperbolic dynamical systems.
These predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the
center bundle equations.

<P>
The central limit theorems and invariance principles
used in this paper are developed in
