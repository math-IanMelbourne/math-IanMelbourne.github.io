<P>
We show that superpolynomial decay of correlations (rapid mixing) is prevalent
for a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows.  These flows are the
continuous time analogue of the class of nonuniformly hyperbolic maps
for which Young proved exponential decay of correlations.
The proof combines techniques of Dolgopyat and renewal theory.

It follows from our results that planar periodic Lorentz flows with
finite horizons and flows near homoclinic tangencies
are typically rapid mixing.
