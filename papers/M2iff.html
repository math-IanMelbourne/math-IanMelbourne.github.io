<P>

We consider a class of planar dispersing billiards with a cusp at a point of vanishing curvature.
Convergence to a stable law and to the corresponding L&eacute;vy process in the M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> Skorohod topologies has been studied in recent work.  Here we show that certain sufficient conditions for M<sub>2</sub>-convergence are also necessary.
