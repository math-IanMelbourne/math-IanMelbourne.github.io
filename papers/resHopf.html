<P>
We consider nonresonant and weakly resonant Hopf bifurcation
from periodic solutions and relative periodic solutions in dynamical systems
with symmetry.
In particular, we analyse phase-locking and irrational torus flows on the
bifurcating relative tori.
<P>
Results are obtained for systems with compact and noncompact symmetry group.
In the noncompact case, we distinguish between bounded and unbounded dynamics.
Applications of our results include secondary Hopf bifurcation from meandering
multi-armed spirals.
