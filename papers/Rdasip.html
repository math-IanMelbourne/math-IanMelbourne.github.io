<P>

We prove an almost sure invariance principle (approximation by d-dimensional
Brownian motion) for vector-valued H&ouml;lder observables of large classes of
nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems.
These systems include Axiom A diffeomorphisms and flows as well as
systems modelled by Young towers with moderate tail decay rates.

<P>
In particular, the position variable of the planar periodic Lorentz gas
with finite horizon approximates a 2-dimensional Brownian motion.
