<P>
We consider special Euclidean (<B>SE</B>(n)) group extensions
of dynamical systems and obtain results on the unboundedness and
growth rates of trajectories for smooth extensions.  The results
depend on n and on the underlying dynamics on the base.
 
<P>
For discrete dynamics on the base with a dense set of periodic points,
we prove unboundedness of trajectories for generic
extensions provided n=2 or n is odd. If in addition the base dynamics is
Anosov, then generically trajectories are unbounded for all n,
exhibit square root growth, and
converge in distribution to a nondegenerate standard n-dimensional
normal distribution.
 
<P>
For sufficiently smooth <B>SE</B>(2)-extensions of
quasiperiodic flows, we prove that trajectories
of the group extension are typically bounded in a probabilistic sense,
but there is a dense set of base rotations for which
extensions are typically unbounded in a topological sense. The results on
unboundedness hold also for <B>SE</B>(n) (n odd) and
for extensions of quasiperiodic maps.
 
<P>
We obtain these results by exploiting the fact that <B>SE</B>(n) has the
semi-direct product structure $\Gamma=G+<B>R</B><sup>n</sup>$ where G is a 
compact
connected Lie group and <B>R</B><sup>n</sup> is a normal abelian subgroup of $\Gamma$.
This means that our results also apply to extensions by this wider class of
groups.
