<P>
We consider mathematical issues concerning Ginzburg-Landau theory,
by which we mean the validity, universality,
and structure of reduced equations near criticality in spatially extended
systems.  The extraction of Ginzburg-Landau equations
(variously known as amplitude, modulation and envelope equations)
is part of this theory.  We pay particular attention
to the Euclidean symmetries present in such systems.
