<P>
In the paper, we prove convergence of moments of all orders for Axiom A 
diffeomorphisms and flows.
The same results hold for nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows 
modelled by Young towers with superpolynomial tails.    
For polynomial tails, we prove convergence of moments up to
a certain order, and give examples where moments diverge when this order is 
exceeded.

<p>

Nonuniformly hyperbolic systems covered by our result include
H&eacute;non-like attractors, Lorenz attractors, semidispersing billiards,
finite horizon planar periodic Lorentz gases, and Pomeau-Manneville
intermittency maps.
