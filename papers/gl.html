<B> Abstract </B> 

<P>
We give a rigorous derivation of the time-dependent
one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation.

<P>
As in the work of Iooss, Mielke and Demay (who derived the steady
Ginzburg-Landau equation) our derivation leads to
a pseudodifferential complex amplitude equation with nonlocal terms of
all orders that yields the
cubic order Ginzburg-Landau equation when truncated.  The truncation
step itself is not justified by our methods.
 
<P>
Furthermore, we prove that the nontruncated Ginzburg-Landau equation
has a normal form <B>SO</B>(2) symmetry to arbitrarily high order.  
The normal form symmetry forces the equation to be odd with constant 
coefficients.  This structure is broken in the tail.
