We prove global-local mixing for a large class of dynamical systems with infinite invariant measure. In particular, we treat intermittent maps including maps with multiple neutral fixed points, nonMarkovian intermittent maps, and multidimensional nonMarkovian intermittent maps.
We also prove global-local mixing for parabolic rational maps of the complex plane.
