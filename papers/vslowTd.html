We prove results on mixing and mixing rates
for toral extensions of nonuniformly expanding
maps with subexponential decay of correlations.
Both the finite and infinite measure settings are considered.
Under a Dolgopyat-type condition on nonexistence of approximate eigenfunctions,
we prove that existing results for (possibly nonMarkovian) nonuniformly expanding maps hold also for their toral extensions.
