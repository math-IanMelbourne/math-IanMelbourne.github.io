<B> Abstract </B>
We give a review of results on superpolynomial decay of correlations, and polynomial decay of correlations for nonuniformly expanding semiflows and nonuniformly hyperbolic flows.   A self-contained proof is given for semiflows.
Results for flows are stated without proof (the proofs are contained in separate joint work with B&aacute;lint and Butterley).
Applications include intermittent solenoidal flows, suspended H\'enon attractors, Lorenz attractors, and various Lorentz gas models including the infinite horizon Lorentz gas.
