<P>
We obtain normal forms for infinitesimally symplectic matrices (or linear
Hamiltonian vector fields) that commute
with the symplectic action of a compact Lie group of symmetries.
In doing so we extend Williamson's theorem on normal forms
when there is no symmetry present.
 
<P>
Using standard representation-theoretic results the symmetry can be factored
out and we reduce to finding normal forms over a real division ring.
There are three real division rings consisting of the real, complex and
quaternionic numbers.  Of these, only the real case is covered in Williamson's
original work.
