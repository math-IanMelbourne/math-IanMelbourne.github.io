<P>
Let $\Gamma\subset<B> O</B>(n)$ be a finite group acting on <B>R</B><sup>n</sup>.
In this work we describe the possible symmetry groups that can occur for  
attractors of smooth (invertible) $\Gamma$-equivariant dynamical systems.  
In case <B>R</B><sup>n</sup> contains no reflection planes and n>4, our results 
imply there are no restrictions on symmmetry groups.  In case n>5 
(diffeomorphisms) and n>6 (flows), we show that we may construct attractors 
which are Axiom A.  We also give a complete description of what can happen 
in low dimensions.
