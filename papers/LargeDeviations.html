We obtain large deviation estimates for a large class of
nonuniformly hyperbolic systems: namely those modelled by Young towers with
summable decay of correlations.
In the case of exponential decay of
correlations, we obtain exponential large deviation estimates given by a rate
function.
In the case of polynomial decay of correlations, we obtain polynomial large
deviation estimates, and exhibit examples where these estimates are
essentially optimal.

<p>
In contrast with many treatments of large deviations, our methods do not
rely on thermodynamic formalism.  Hence, for H&ouml;lder observables we are
able to obtain
exponential estimates in situations where the
space of equilibrium measures is not known to be a singleton, as well
as polynomial estimates in situations where there is not a unique
equilibrium measure.
