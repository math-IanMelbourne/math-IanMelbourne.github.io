<B> Abstract </B> 

<P>
The admissible symmetry groups of attractors for continuous equivariant mappings
were classified in 
<a href="sym.html"> Ashwin and Melbourne  </a>
and <a href="struc.html">
Melbourne, Dellnitz and Golubitsky </a>.
We consider extensions
of these results to include attractors in fixed-point subspaces, attractors
for equivariant diffeomorphisms and flows [1], and attractors in the presence
of a continuous symmetry group [2].  Our results lead to surprising (if
somewhat speculative) implications for both theory and applications [3]
of equivariant dynamical systems.

        <HR>

[1] The results on attractors for diffeomorphisms and flows are very
preliminary and are completed in 
<a href="dif.html"> Field, Melbourne and Nicol  </a>

<P>
[2] The results on attractors in the presence of a continuous symmetry group
are made more precise and extended in 
<a href="ab.html"> Melbourne and Stewart  </a>
(see also
<a href="shad.html"> Dellnitz and Melbourne  </a>
).

<P>
[3] For more on the implications for applications, see
<a href="app.html"> Melbourne  </a>
