<B> Abstract </B> 
The transfer operator corresponding to a uniformly expanding map enjoys good spectral properties.  Here it is verified that coupling yields explicit estimates that depend continuously on the expansion and distortion constants of the map.

For nonuniformly expanding maps with a uniformly expanding induced map, we obtain explicit estimates for mixing rates (exponential, stretched exponential, polynomial) that again depend continuously on the constants for the induced map together with data associated to the inducing time.

Finally, for nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations, we obtain the corresponding estimates for rates of decay of correlations.
