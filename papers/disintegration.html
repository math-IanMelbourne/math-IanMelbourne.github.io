<B> Abstract </B> 
<P>
We study hyperbolic skew products and the disintegration  of the SRB measure into measures supported on local stable manifolds.
Such a disintegration gives a method for passing from an observable v on the skew product to an observable <span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> on the system quotiented along stable manifolds.
Under mild assumptions on the system we prove that the disintegration preserves the smoothness of v, firstly in the case where v is H&ouml;older and secondly in the case where v is C<sup>1</sup>.
