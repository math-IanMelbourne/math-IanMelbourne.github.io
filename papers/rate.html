<P>
We obtain the first results on convergence rates in the Prokhorov metric for the weak invariance principle (functional central limit theorem) for deterministic dynamical systems.  Our results hold for uniformly expanding/hyperbolic (Axiom A) systems, as well as nonuniformly expanding/hyperbolic  systems such as dispersing billiards, H&eacute;non-like attractors, Viana maps and intermittent maps.  As an application, we obtain convergence rates for deterministic homogenization in multiscale systems.

I am grateful to Nicol&ograve; Paviato for pointing out the following:

<p>
&bull; In the third line of the proof of Lemma 4.3, it is claimed that
&lambda;<sub>2</sub>
<< &lambda;<sub>1</sub>. What is true (and what is used) is that the estimate for &lambda;<sub>2</sub> in the previous line is no worse (up to a constant) than that for &lambda;<sub>1</sub>.

<p>
&bull; Definition 6.1(b). &chi; should be &psi;.

<p>
&bull; Remark 6.2. "Young tails" should be "Young towers".

<p>
&bull; In the proof of Theorem 6.3, on line 3, we can take &delta;=0.
Indeed, the estimate on line 2 has the form |Y<sub>n</sub>-Y<sub>n</sub>'|<sub>&infin;</sub> &leq; Cn<sup>-1/2</sup>
so P(|Y<sub>n</sub>-Y<sub>n</sub>'|<sub>&infin;</sub> &geq; 2Cn<sup>-1/2</sup>) = 0 and hence
&pi;<sub>1</sub>(Y<sub>n</sub>,Y<sub>n</sub>') &leq; 2Cn<sup>-1/2</sup> by Proposition 4.5(a).
