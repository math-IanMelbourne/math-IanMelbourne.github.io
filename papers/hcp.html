<P>
Heteroclinic cycles are a natural source of nonasymptotically stable
attractors in systems with symmetry.  In this paper,  stability
properties are completely classified for a large class of heteroclinic
cycles.  In particular, we establish the existence of several nonasymptotically
stable attractors in codimension two mode interactions with <B>O</B>(2)
symmetry, in the process explaining the results of some numerical experiments.
In the Hopf/Hopf mode interaction we show that two heteroclinic cycles can
 coexist as nonasymptotically stable attractors.
