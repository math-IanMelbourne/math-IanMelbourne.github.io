<P>
Let f:X->X be the restriction to a hyperbolic basic set of a
smooth diffeomorphism. We find several criteria for transitivity
of noncompact connected Lie group extensions. As a consequence, we find
transitive extensions for any matrix group extension.
If, in addition, the group is perfect and has an open set
of elements that generate a compact subgroup, we find open
sets of <em> stably</em> transitive extensions. In particular, we find
stably transitive SL(2,<b>R</b>)-extensions.    More generally,
we find stably transitive Sp(2n,<b>R</b>)-extensions for all n.
For the Euclidean groups SE(n) with n>2 even, we obtain a new
proof of 
a result of <a href="trans.html" >Melbourne and Nicol </a>  stating that 
there is an open and dense set of extensions that are transitive.

<P>
For groups of the form K x <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> where K is compact, a 
separation condition is necessary for transitivity.   
Provided X is a hyperbolic
attractor, we show that an open and dense set of extensions satisfying
the separation condition are transitive.   This generalises a result of
Ni&#355;ic&#259; and Pollicott for <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>-extensions.
