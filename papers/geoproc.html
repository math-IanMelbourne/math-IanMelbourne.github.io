<P>
The Earth's magnetic field is by and large a steady dipole, but its
history has been punctuated by intermittent excursions and reversals.
This is at least superficially similar to the behaviour of differential
equations containing structurally stable heteroclinic cycles.  We present
a model of the geodynamo that is based on the symmetries of velocity
fields in a rotating spherical shell, and that contains such a cycle.
Patterns of excursions and reversals that resemble the geomagnetic 
record can be obtained by introducing small symmetry-breaking terms.
