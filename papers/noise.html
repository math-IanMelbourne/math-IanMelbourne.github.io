<P>
Recently, we introduced a new <a href="01chaos.html"> test</a> for 
distinguishing regular from
chaotic dynamics in deterministic dynamical systems and argued that
the test had certain advantages over the traditional test
for chaos using the maximal Lyapunov exponent.

<P>
In this paper, we investigate the capability of the test to cope with
moderate amounts of noisy data.   Comparisons are made between
an improved version of our test and both the ``tangent space''
and ``direct method'' for computing the maximal Lyapunov exponent.
The evidence of numerical experiments, ranging from the logistic map
to an eight-dimensional Lorenz system of differential equations
(the Lorenz 96 system), suggests that our method is superior to
tangent space methods and that it compares very favourably with direct methods.
