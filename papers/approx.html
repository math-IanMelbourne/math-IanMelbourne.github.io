Consider an It&ocirc; process X satisfying the stochastic differential equation
dX=a(X)dt+b(X)dW where a,b are smooth and W is a multidimensional Brownian motion.
Suppose that W<sub>n</sub> has smooth sample paths and that W<sub>n</sub> converges weakly to W.  A central question in stochastic analysis is to understand the limiting behaviour of solutions X<sub>n</sub> to the ordinary differential equation dX<sub>n</sub>=a(X<sub>n</sub>)dt+b(X<sub>n</sub>)dW<sub>n</sub>.
<P>
The classical Wong-Zakai theorem gives sufficient conditions under which X<sub>n</sub> converges weakly to X provided that the stochastic integral &int; b(X)dW is given the Stratonovich interpretation.  The sufficient conditions are automatic in one dimension, but in higher dimensions the correct interpretation of
&int; b(X)dW depends sensitively on how the smooth approximation W<sub>n</sub> is chosen.

In applications, a natural class of smooth approximations arise by setting
$W<sub>n</sub>(t)=n<sup>-1/2</sup>&int;<sub>0</sub><sup>nt</sup>v o &phi;<sub>s</sub> ds$ where &phi;<sub>t</sub> is a flow (generated for instance by an ordinary differential equation) and v is a mean zero observable.
Under mild conditions on &phi;<sub>t</sub> we give a definitive answer to the interpretation question for the stochastic integral &int; b(X)dW.
Our theory applies to Anosov or Axiom A flows &phi;<sub>t</sub>, as well as to a large class of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows (including the one defined by the well-known Lorenz equations) and our main results do not require any mixing assumptions on &phi;<sub>t</sub>.

The methods used in this paper are a combination of rough path theory and smooth ergodic theory.

 The proofs for moments and iterated moments in Proposition 7.1 are correct for noninvertible maps but not for invertible maps since the martingales are not adapted.
 Also, the results for iterated moments are suboptimal.
 <p></p>Optimal results for moments were obtained in Proposition 2.6 of <a href="DMN.html">Demers, Melbourne & Nicol</a>.  
 Proposition 2.7 of that paper gives a correct but suboptiomal result for iterated moments.
 <p></p>Optimal results for iterated momemnts for noninvertible systems were obtained in Theorem 2.4 of <a href="KKMPart1.html">Korepanov, Kosloff & Melbourne</a>.
 <p></p>The optimal result for iterated moments for invertible systems is much more subtle and was eventually obtained by 
 Nicholas Fleming-V&aacute;zquez in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06486">paper</a>:

 The indices &beta; and &gamma; in various formulas for modified drift (Theorem 1.2 for instance) have been interchanged.
 The correct formulas are given in <a href="iwip.html" > Galton & Melbourne.</a>

 <p></p>
 For some reason, the inducing step for flows in Theorem 6.1 is written incorrectly. In particular, the application of Eagleson/Zweim&uuml;ller is done incorrectly.
 It should be done as in the similar step in <a href="susp.html">Melbourne & T&ouml;r&ouml;k.</a>
