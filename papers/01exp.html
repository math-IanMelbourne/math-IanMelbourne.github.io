<P>
A reliable and efficient method to distinguish between chaotic and non-chaotic
behaviour in noise-contaminated, but essentially stationary and deterministic,
times series data has far reaching applications. 
Recently, we proposed a new method for detecting chaos which applies directly
to the time series data and does not require phase space reconstruction.  
To illustrate the effectiveness of the method for experimental data, we analyse
data from a bipolar motor.
