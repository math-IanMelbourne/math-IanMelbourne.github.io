<P>

We show that polynomial decay of correlations is prevalent
for a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows.  These flows are the
continuous time analogue of a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms for which Young proved polynomial decay of correlations.
Roughly speaking, in situations where the decay rate O(1/n<SUP>p</SUP>) has
previously been proved for diffeomorphisms, we establish the decay rate
O(1/t<SUP>p</SUP>) for flows.
Applications include certain classes of semidispersing billiards, as well as
dispersing billiards with vanishing curvature.

<P>
In addition, we obtain results for suspension flows with unbounded roof
functions.  In particular, the classical
planar Lorentz flow with a doubly periodic array of
circular scatterers has decay rate 1/t as anticipated by physicists.
