<P>
It is shown that asymptotically stable branches of equilibria may generically 
bifurcate from a spherically symmetric solution that loses stability to
spherical harmonics of order l for any odd l.  The problem is reduced to
one of evaluation of certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.  The evaluation
uses methods from the quantum mechanical theory of angular momentum.
