<P>
In this paper we address practical aspects of the implementation of
the 0-1 test for chaos. In addition, we present a new formulation
of the test which significantly increases its sensitivity. The test
can be viewed as a method to distill a binary quantity from the power
spectrum.  The implementation is guided by recent results from the
theoretical justification of the test as well as by exploring better
statistical methods to determine the binary quantities. We give
several examples to illustrate the improvement.
