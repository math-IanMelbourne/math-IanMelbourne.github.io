<p>
We prove statistical limit laws for sequences of Birkhoff sums of the type
&Sigma;<sub>0&le;j&le;n-1</sub>v<sub>n</sub> o T<sub>n</sub><sup>j</sup> where T<sub>n</sub> is a family of
nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations.

<p>
The key ingredient is a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for
nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations which is useful already in the case when the family T<sub>n</sub> is replaced by a fixed transformation T, and which is particularly effective in
the case when T<sub>n</sub> varies with n.

<p>
 In addition to uniformly expanding/hyperbolic dynamical systems, our results include cases where
 the family T<sub>n</sub> consists of intermittent maps, unimodal maps 
(along the Collet-Eckmann parameters), Viana maps, and externally forced dispersing billiards.

<p>
As an application, we prove a homogenization result for discrete fast-slow systems where the fast dynamics is generated by a family of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations.

 Example 4.10.  ce^{bn} should be ce^{bk}.

In Section 7.1, need an additional assumption that
$a_0$ is Holder in y for every fixed x. (This ensures in the proof of
Proposition 7.5 that \beta_{x,\eps} is Holder.)

Corollary 3.2 is stated suboptimally in L^p.  Should be L^{2(p-1)} as
mentioned in Prop 3.5 of Antoniou & M.
