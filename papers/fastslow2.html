<B> Abstract </B> 

Consider a fast-slow system of ordinary differential equations of the form 
<P>
x'=a(x,y)+&epsilon;<SUP>-1</SUP>b(x,y), y'=&epsilon;<sup>-2</sup>g(y),
<P>
where it is assumed that b averages to zero under the fast flow generated by g.  We give conditions under which solutions x to the slow equations converge weakly to an It&#244; diffusion X as &epsilon;&rarr;0.  The drift and diffusion coefficients of the limiting stochastic differential equation satisfied by X are given explicitly.

<P>
Our theory applies when the fast flow is Anosov or Axiom A, as well as to a large class of nonuniformly hyperbolic fast flows (including the one defined by the well-known Lorenz equations), and our main results do not require any mixing assumptions on the fast flow.
