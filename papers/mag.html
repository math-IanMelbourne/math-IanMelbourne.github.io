<P>
In 1972, Childress and Soward proposed the existence of a self-sustained
magnetic dynamo through secondary bifurcation from a purely
convective state in rotating B&#233;nard convection.
 
<P>
It was only in the late '70s that the nature of the primary convective states
in rotating convection was investigated.  The standard rolls solution is stable
for low rotation rates.  At higher rates of rotation, rolls are unstable but
there is a robust homoclinic cycle, the Busse-Heikes cycle,
connecting rolls that are mutually oriented at 60<sup>o</sup>.

<P>
In this paper, we consider the full magnetohydrodynamic equations and analyze
secondary bifurcations both from stable rolls and from the Busse-Heikes cycle.
In particular, we show how the proposed solution of Childress and Soward
to the linear stability (kinematic dynamo) problem, together with established
techniques from equivariant dynamical systems, yields solutions to the
full nonlinear dynamo problem.  We obtain steady, periodic, quasiperiodic and
intermittent weak-field dynamos.
