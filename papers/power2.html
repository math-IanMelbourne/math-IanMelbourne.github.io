We present results on the broadband nature of the power spectrum S(&omega;), &omega;&isin;(0,2&pi;), for a large class of nonuniformly expanding maps with summable and nonsummable decay of correlations.
 In particular, we consider a class of intermittent maps f:[0,1]&rarr;[0,1] with f(x)&asymp; x<sup>1+&gamma;</sup> for x&asymp;0, where &gamma;&isin;(0,1).
  Such maps have summable decay of correlations when &gamma;&isin;(0,1/2), and S(&omega;) extends to a continuous function on [0,2&pi;] by the classical Wiener-Khintchine Theorem.  We show that S(&omega;) is typically bounded away from zero for H&ouml;lder observables.

  <P>
  Moreover, in the nonsummable case &gamma;&isin;[1/2,1), we show that S(&omega;) is defined almost everywhere with a continuous extension S<sub>0</sub>(&omega;) defined on (0,2&pi;), and S<sub>0</sub>(&omega;) is typically nonvanishing.
