<P>
Relative periodic solutions are ubiquitous in dynamical systems with
continuous symmetry.  Recently, Sandstede, Scheel and Wulff derived
a center bundle theorem, reducing local bifurcation from relative
periodic solutions to a finite dimensional problem.  Independently, 
<a href="drw.html">Lamb and Melbourne</a>
showed how to systematically study local bifurcation from isolated periodic 
solutions with discrete spatiotemporal symmetries.
 
<P>
In this paper, we show how the center bundle theorem, when
combined with certain group theoretic results, reduces bifurcation from
relative periodic solutions to bifurcation from isolated periodic
solutions.  In this way, we obtain
a systematic approach to the study of local bifurcation from
relative periodic solutions.
