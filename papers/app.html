<P>
We describe some recent results on symmetry of
attractors for dynamical systems with symmetry and consider the
implications for the Couette-Taylor experiment and the Faraday surface
wave experiment.  In particular, we explore the relationship between
symmetry of solutions at a fixed instant in time, and symmetry in the
time-averaged solution.  This leads to predictions that are somewhat
surprising and which we believe require careful experimental
exploration.
