<P>
In this paper we show that in <B>O</B>(2) symmetric systems, structurally
stable, asymptotically stable, heteroclinic cycles can be found which
connect periodic solutions with steady states and periodic solutions with
periodic solutions.  These cycles are found in the third-order truncated
normal forms of specific codimension two steady-state/Hopf and Hopf/Hopf
mode interactions.

<P>
We find these cycles using group-theoretic techniques; in particular, we look
for certain patterns in the lattice of isotropy subgroups.  Once the
pattern has been identified, the heteroclinic cycle can be constructed by
decomposing the vector field on fixed-point subspaces into
phase/amplitude equations (it is here that we use the assumption of normal
form).  The final proof of existence (and stability) relies on explicit
calculations showing that certain eigenvalue restrictions can be satisfied.
