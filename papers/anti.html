<BR>
We show that there is a natural restriction on the smoothness of spaces where the transfer operator for a continuous dynamical system has a spectral gap.
Such a space cannot be embedded in a H&ouml;lder space with
H&ouml;lder exponent greater than 1/2 unless it consists entirely of coboundaries.
