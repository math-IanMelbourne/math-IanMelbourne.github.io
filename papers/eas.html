<P>
We give an example of an invariant set that is not asymptotically stable but
which has the following strong attracting properties.  `Almost all' 
trajectories that start close to the invariant set behave as if the set were
asymptotically stable, that is, these trajectories remain close and converge
to the invariant set.  The term `almost all' means here that the only 
trajectories that escape lie in a cuspoidal region abutting the invariant set.

<P>
Our example is a heteroclinic cycle forced by symmetry.  The surprising
feature is that nodes on the cycle may have unstable eigenvalues in 
directions `normal' to the cycle, and yet the cycle is stable in the above
sense.  This type of stability appears to explain some numerical experiments.
