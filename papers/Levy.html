We consider
weak invariance principles (functional limit theorems) in the domain of a stable law.   A general result is obtained on lifting such limit laws from an induced dynamical system to the original system.  An important class of examples covered by
our result are Pomeau-Manneville intermittency maps, where convergence for the
induced system is in the standard Skorohod J<sub>1</sub> topology.  For the full system, convergence in the J<sub>1</sub> topology fails, but we prove convergence in
the M<sub>1</sub> topology.
