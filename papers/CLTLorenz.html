<B> Abstract </B>

<P>
For geometric
Lorenz attractors (including the classical Lorenz attractor)
we obtain a greatly simplified proof of the central limit theorem
which applies also to
the more general class of codimension two singular hyperbolic attractors.
<P>
We also obtain the functional central limit theorem and moment estimates, as well as iterated versions of these results.  A consequence is deterministic homogenisation (convergence to a stochastic differential equation) for fast-slow dynamical systems whenever the fast dynamics is singularly hyperbolic of codimension two.
