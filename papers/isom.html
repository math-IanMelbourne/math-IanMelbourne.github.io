<P>
We consider the statistical behaviour of i.i.d. compositions
of a finite set of Euclidean  isometries of <B>R</B><SUP>n</SUP>$.
We give a new proof of the
central limit theorem and weak invariance principles, and we obtain the
law of the iterated logarithm.
Our results generalise immediately to Markov chains.

We also give simple geometric criteria for orbits to grow linearly or
sublinearly with probability one and for nondegeneracy (nonsingular
covariance matrix) in the statistical limit theorems.

Our proofs are based on dynamical systems theory rather than a
purely probabilistic approach.
