<P>
We obtain results on large deviations for a large class
of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems
with polynomial decay of correlations n<sup>-b</sup>, b>0.   This includes
systems modelled by Young towers with polynomial tails, extending recent
work of M. Nicol and the author which assumed b>1.
As a byproduct of the proof, we obtain slightly stronger results even when
b>1.
The results are sharp in the sense that there exist examples
(such as Pomeau-Manneville intermittency maps) for which the obtained
rates are best possible.
In addition, we obtain results on moderate deviations.
