<P>
A standard use of shadowing lemmas in dynamical systems theory
is to prove density of periodic points.  When there is symmetry
present it is natural to investigate the density of periodic
points of a given symmetry.  We obtain several results in this
direction.
As an application, we prove a result about compact group extensions
of hyperbolic and nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems.
