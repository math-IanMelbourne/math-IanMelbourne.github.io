<B> Abstract </B> 

We give a unified treatment of decay of correlations for nonuniformly expanding systems with a good inducing scheme.
In addition to being more elementary than previous treatments, our
results hold for general integrable return time functions under fairly mild conditions
on the inducing scheme.
