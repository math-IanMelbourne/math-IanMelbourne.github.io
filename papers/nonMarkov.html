We develop an abstract framework for obtaining optimal rates of mixing and higher order asymptotics for
infinite measure semiflows.
Previously, such results were restricted to the situation where there is a first return Poincar&eacute; map that is uniformly expanding and Markov.
As illustrations of the method, we consider semiflows
over nonMarkov Pomeau-Manneville intermittent maps with infinite measure, and we also obtain mixing rates for semiflows over Collet-Eckmann maps with nonintegrable roof function.
