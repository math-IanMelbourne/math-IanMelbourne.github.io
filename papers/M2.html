<B> Abstract </B>

<P>

We prove convergence to a L&eacute;vy process for a class of dispersing billiards with cusps.  For such examples, convergence to a stable law was proved by Jung & Zhang.  For the corresponding functional limit law, convergence is not possible in the usual Skorohod J<sub>1</sub> topology.
Our main results yield elementary geometric conditions for convergence (i) in M<sub>1</sub>, (ii) in M<sub>2</sub> but not M<sub>1</sub>.
As far as we know, this is the first instance where the M<sub>2</sub> topology arises naturally.

<P>
In general, we show
for a large class of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems how to deduce functional limit laws once convergence to the corresponding stable law is known.
