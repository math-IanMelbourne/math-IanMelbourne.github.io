<B> Abstract </B> 

We consider families of fast-slow skew product maps of the form
<P>
x<sub>n+1</sub>   = x<sub>n</sub> + &epsilon; a(x<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n</sub>,&epsilon;),
y<sub>n+1</sub>   = T<sub>&epsilon;</sub> y<sub>n</sub>,
</P>
<P>
	where T<sub>&epsilon;</sub> is a family of nonuniformly expanding maps, and
      prove averaging and rates of averaging for the slow variables x as &epsilon;&rarr;0.   Similar results are obtained also for continuous time systems
      <P>
	x'   =  &epsilon; a(x,y,&epsilon;), 
	y'   =  g<sub >&epsilon;</sub>(y).
	<P>

Our results include cases where the family of fast dynamical systems consists of intermittent maps, unimodal maps (along the Collet-Eckmann parameters) and Viana maps.
