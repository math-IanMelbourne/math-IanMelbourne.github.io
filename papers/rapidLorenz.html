<B> Abstract </B>

<P>
 We prove that every geometric Lorenz attractor has
   superpolynomial decay of correlations with respect
   to the unique SRB measure.  Moreover, we prove the
   Central Limit Theorem and Almost Sure Invariance
   Principle for the time-1 map of the flow of
   geometric Lorenz attractors.  In particular, our
   results apply to the classical Lorenz attractor.

<B>Typos, etc:</B> The proof of smoothness of the stable foliation presupposes that the
foliation foliates. This is rectified in the paper by <a href="foliations.html">Ara&uacute;jo & Melbourne</p>.
