<P>
Discrete rotating waves are periodic solutions that have discrete
spatiotemporal symmetries in addition to their purely spatial symmetries.
We present a systematic approach to the study of local bifurcation
from discrete rotating waves.   The approach centers around the analysis
of diffeomorphisms that are equivariant with respect to distinct
group actions in the domain and the range.

<P>
Our results are valid for dynamical systems with finite symmetry group,
and more generally for bifurcations from <EM> isolated </EM> discrete
rotating waves in dynamical systems with compact symmetry group.
