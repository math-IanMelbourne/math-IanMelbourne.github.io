<P>
        In the numerical treatment of bifurcation problems one of the main
        tasks is to control the spectrum of matrices in a parametrized
        family.
        If the original problem possesses symmetry, then the
        matrices are additionally equivariant.
        Previously the generic eigenvalue behavior in a one-parameter family
        of equivariant matrices has been studied for the case of general
        matrices by Golubitsky, Stewart and Schaeffer and for infinitesimally 
	symplectic matrices
<a href="ham.html">Dellnitz, Melbourne and Marsden</a>.
        However, in applications the situation frequently occurs that
        the matrices of the family are selfadjoint.
        We classify the generic eigenvalue behavior in such a
        family of equivariant matrices by the type of underlying symmetry.
