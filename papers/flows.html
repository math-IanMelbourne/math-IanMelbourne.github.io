<B> Abstract </B>
We prove sharp results on polynomial decay of correlations for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows.
Applications include intermittent solenoidal flows and various Lorentz gas models including the infinite horizon Lorentz gas.

<b>Minor typos, etc</b>

<p>

In Section 7.1, it is incorrectly claimed that condition (7.3) implies condition (3.2). The latter should be assumed in addition to the other conditions. However, condition (3.2) is always satisfied in settings where the Young tower approach applies so this extra assumption is harmless.
<p>
 &psi;<sub>n</sub> in equations (7.2) and (7.3) is written incorrectly. It is supposed to measure the number of <em>good</em> returns to Y by time n. 
 (If it had been defined using the associated tower map, then the definition would have been correct.)
 One way to fix it is to define &tau;<sub>k</sub>
 =&sum;<sub>0&leq;j&lt;k</sub>&tau;&circ;F<sup>j</sup> and set  &psi;<sub>n</sub>=N where
  &tau;<sub>N</sub>&leq;n&lt;&tau;<sub>N+1</sub>.
