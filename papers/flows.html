<B> Abstract </B>
We prove sharp results on polynomial decay of correlations for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows.
Applications include intermittent solenoidal flows and various Lorentz gas models including the infinite horizon Lorentz gas.

In Section 7.1, it is incorrectly claimed that condition (7.3) implies condition (3.2). The latter should be assumed in addition to the other conditions. However, condition (3.2) is always satisfied in settings where the Young tower approach applies so this extra assumption is harmless.
