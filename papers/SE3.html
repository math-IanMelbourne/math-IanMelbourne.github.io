<P>
Let f:X->X be the restriction to a hyperbolic basic set of a smooth
diffeomorphism. We show that in the class of C<SUP>r</SUP>, r>0, cocycles
with fiber special Euclidean group SE(n) those that are transitive
form a residual set (countable intersection of open dense sets).
This result is new for n>2 odd.
<p>
More generally, we consider Euclidean-type groups G \ltimes <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>
where G is a compact connected Lie group acting linearly on <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>.
When Fix G={0}, it is again the case that the transitive cocycles
are residual. 
Otherwise, the same result holds on restriction to
the subset of cocycles that avoid an obvious and explicit obstruction to
transitivity.
