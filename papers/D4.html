<P>
We study a codimension two steady-state/steady-state mode interaction
with <B>D</B><sub>4</sub> symmetry, where the centre manifold is three-dimensional.
Primary branches of equilibria undergo secondary Hopf bifurcation
to periodic solutions which undergo tertiary bifurcations leading
to chaotic dynamics.
This is not an exponentially small effect, and the chaos
obtained in simulations using DsTool is large-scale, in contrast to
the `weak' chaos associated with Shilnikov theory.
<P>
Moreover, there is an abundance of
<EM>  symmetric chaotic attractors </EM> and <EM> symmetry-increasing bifurcations</EM>.
Numerical investigations demonstrate that the symmetric chaos
is part of the local codimension two bifurcation.
The two-dimensional parameter space is mapped out in detail for
a specific choice of Taylor coefficients for the centre manifold
vector field.  We use AUTO to
compute the transitions involving periodic solutions, Lyapunov
exponents to determine the chaotic region, and symmetry detectives
to determine the symmetries of the various attractors.
