<B> Abstract </B> 

We develop a theory of operator renewal sequences in the
context of infinite ergodic theory.  For large classes of dynamical
systems preserving an infinite measure, we determine the asymptotic behaviour
of iterates L<sup>n</sup> of the transfer operator.
This was previously  an intractable problem.

<P>
Examples of systems covered by our results include (i) parabolic
rational maps of the complex plane and (ii) (not necessarily
Markovian) nonuniformly expanding interval maps with indifferent
fixed points.

<P>
In addition, we give a particularly simple proof of pointwise dual ergodicity
(asymptotic behaviour of L+L<sup>2</sup>+...+L<sup>n</sup>) 
for the class of systems under consideration.

<P>
In certain situations, including Pomeau-Manneville intermittency maps, we
obtain higher order expansions for L<sup>n</sup> and rates of mixing.
Also, we obtain error estimates in the associated Dynkin-Lamperti arcsine laws.
