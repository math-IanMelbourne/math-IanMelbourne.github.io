<P>
Systems possessing symmetries often admit <EM> robust </EM> heteroclinic cycles
that persist under perturbations that respect the symmetry.
In <a href="hc.html">previous work</a>, we began a systematic investigation into the asymptotic
stability of such cycles.
In particular, we found a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability, and
we gave algebraic criteria for deciding when this condition is also necessary.
These criteria are always satisfied for cycles in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP>.
<P>
Field & Swift and Hofbauer considered examples in <B>R</B><SUP>4</SUP> for which our
sufficient condition for stability is not optimal.  They obtained necessary
and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability using a <EM> transition
matrix </EM> technique.
<P>
In this paper, we combine our previous methods with the transition matrix
technique and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic
stability for a larger class of heteroclinic cycles.
In particular, we obtain a complete theory for ``simple'' heteroclinic cycles
in <B>R</B><SUP>4</SUP> (thereby proving and extending results for homoclinic cycles that were 
stated without proof by <a href="hct.html"> Chossat, Krupa, Melbourne and Scheel </a>).  A partial
classification of simple heteroclinic cycles in <B>R</B><SUP>4</SUP> is also given.
Finally, our stability results generalise naturally to higher dimensions
and many of the higher-dimensional examples in the literature are covered by
this theory.
