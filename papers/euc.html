<B> Abstract </B> 

<P>
We consider systems of partial differential equations equivariant under
the Euclidean group <B>E</B>(n) and undergoing steady-state bifurcation
(with nonzero critical wavenumber) from a fully symmetric equilibrium.
A rigorous reduction procedure is presented that leads
locally to an optimally small system of equations.
In particular, when n=1 and n=2 and for reaction-diffusion equations
with general n, reduction leads to a single equation.
(Our results are valid generically, with perturbations
consisting of relatively bounded partial differential operators.)

<P>
In analogy with equivariant bifurcation theory for compact groups, we
give a classification of the different types of reduced systems in
terms of the absolutely irreducible unitary representations of <B>E</B>(n).
The representation theory of <B>E</B>(n)$ is driven by the irreducible
representations of <B>O</B>(n-1).  For n=1, this constitutes a
mathematical statement of the `universality' of the Ginzburg-Landau equation
on the line.  (In 
<a href="gl.html"> <b> recent work </b>  </a>
we addressed the validity of this
equation using related techniques.)

<P> 
When n=2, there are precisely two
significantly different types of reduced equation: 
<EM>scalar</EM> and 
<a href="plan.html"> <b> 
<EM>pseudoscalar</EM> </b> </a>, corresponding to the trivial and
nontrivial one-dimensional representations of <B>O</B>(1).
There are infinitely many possibilities for each n>2.
