<P>
In this paper, we discuss some recent developments in the understanding
of generic bifurcation from periodic solutions with spatiotemporal symmetries.
We focus mainly on the theory for bifurcation from <EM> isolated </EM>
periodic solutions in dynamical systems with a compact symmetry group.
 
<P>
Moreover, we discuss how our theory justifies certain
heuristic assumptions underlying previous approaches towards
period preserving and period doubling bifurcation from periodic solutions.
