<P>
 We obtain sharp results for the genericity and stability of transitivity,    
  ergodicity and mixing for compact connected Lie group extensions over a      
  hyperbolic basic set of a C<SUP>2</SUP> diffeomorphism.  In contrast                 
  to previous work, our results hold for general hyperbolic basic sets and     
  are valid in the C<SUP>r</SUP> topology for all r>0 (except that 
C<SUP>1</SUP> is          
  replaced by Lipschitz).  Moreover, when r is at least 2, we show that    
  there is a C<SUP>2</SUP> open and C<SUP>r</SUP> dense subset of 
C<SUP>r</SUP> extensions that are ergodic.                                                                     
<p>                                                                             
  We obtain similar results on stable transitivity for (non-compact)           
  <B>R</B><SUP>m</SUP>-extensions, thereby generalizing a result of Nitica &
  Pollicott, and on stable mixing for suspension flows.
