<B> Abstract </B>

<P>
We prove exponential decay of correlations for a class of C<sup>1+&alpha;</sup> uniformly hyperbolic skew product flows, subject to a uniform nonintegrability condition.
In particular, this establishes exponential decay of correlations for an open and dense set of geometric Lorenz attractors.
As a special case, we show that the classical Lorenz attractor is robustly exponentially mixing.

<b>Minor typos, etc:</b>

<p>
In the statement of Lemma 2.23, |b| &leq; D' should be |b| &geq; D' (twice).

<p>
For the second statement of Proposition 2.18, it would be more natural to write:

<p>
&int;<sub>Y</sub> e<sup>&epsilon;r</sup> d Leb
  =&sum;<sub>h &in; H</sub> &int;<sub>h(Y)</sub>e<sup>&epsilon;r</sup> d Leb
 =&sum;<sub>h &in; H</sub> &int;<sub>Y</sub> e<sup>&epsilon;r o h</sup>|h'| d Leb
 &leq; &sum;<sub>h &in; H</sub> e<sup>&epsilon;|r o h|<sub>&infin;</sub></sup>|h'|<sub>&infin;</sub>
 which is finite by condition (iv).
This proves the second statement since d&mu; / d Leb is bounded.

<P>
Condition (2.6) can be deleted.

<P>
Condition (2.5) would be more accurately written as
||h'x|-|h'y|| &leq; C<sub>1</sub>|h'|<sub>&infin;</sub> |x-y|<sup>&alpha;</sup> for all h &in; H, x,y &in; Y
(and the preceding sentence could be erased).
Observe that 1-t &leq; - log t for all t>0 and so
a-b=a(1-b/a) &leq; a(log a-log b) for all a>b>0.
Hence ||h'x|-|h'y|| &leq; |h'|<sub>&infin;</sub>(log |h'x|-log |h'y|).
Now apply condition (ii).

<p>
Similarly, condition (2.7) should be replaced by
||h'x|-|h'y|| &leq; C<sub>2</sub>|h'|<sub>&infin;</sub> |x-y|<sup>&alpha;</sup> &leq; C<sub>2</sub>e<sup>C<sub>2</sub></sup>|h'z| |x-y|<sup>&alpha;</sup>
for all h &in; H<sub>n</sub>, x,y,z &in; Y

 <p> This paper inherits a gap in reference [2] <a href="rapidLorenz">Ara&uacute;jo, Melbourne & Varandas</a> concerning the existence of the stable foliation.
 This gap is clarified and fixed in the subsequent paper by <a href="foliations.html">Ara&uacute;jo & Melbourne.</p>
