<P>
We consider the dynamics of semiflows of patterns on unbounded domains
that are equivariant under a noncompact group action. We exploit the unbounded
nature of the domain in a setting where there is a strong `global' norm and
a weak `local' norm. Relative equilibria whose group orbits are closed manifolds for a
compact group action need not be closed in a noncompact setting;
the closure of a group orbit of a solution can contain `co-solutions'.

<P>
The main result of the paper is to show that co-solutions inherit stability
in the sense that co-solutions of a Lyapunov stable pattern are also stable (but
in a weaker sense). This means that the existence of a single group orbit
of stable relative equilibria may force the existence of quite
distinct group orbits of relative equilibria, and these are also stable. This is in
contrast to the case for finite dimensional dynamical systems where group orbits
of relative equilibria are typically isolated.
